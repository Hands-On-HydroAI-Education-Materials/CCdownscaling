# TensorFlow Self-Organizing Map
An implementation of the Kohonen self-organizing map<sup>1</sup> for TensorFlow 1.5 and Python 3.6. This was initially based
off of [Sachin Joglekar's](https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/self-organizing-maps-with-googles-tensorflow/)
code but has a few key modifications:
 * Uses TensorFlow broadcasting semantics instead of `tf.pack` and `for` loops.
 * Input data is expected from a `Tensor` rather than a `tf.placeholder`, allowing for use with faster and more complex
 input data pipelines.
 * Training uses the batch algorithm rather than the online one, providing a major speed boost if you have the GPU RAM.
 Also, as a result of that, I added...
 * Multi-GPU support (for single machines with multiple GPUs, it doesn't have multi-node training).
 * Some summary operations for Tensorboard visualization

 `example.py` contains a simple example of its usage by training a SOM on a 3 cluster toy dataset. The resulting
 u-matrix should look something like this:

 I was going to write a blog post about this but I ended up just repeating everything I wrote in the comments,
 so please read them if you'd like to understand the code. For reference, the batch formula for SOMs is

 where theta is the neighborhood function and x is the input vector.
 
 Some alterations made by Drew Polasky for ease of use in climate model downscaling.
